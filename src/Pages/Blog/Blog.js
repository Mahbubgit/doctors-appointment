                                    Firebase is an app development platform that helps us to build and grow apps and games that users choise. It manages all data real-time in the database. So, the exchange of data to and from the database is easy and quick.

                                    Firebase is a set of tools offered by Google to build excellent scalable applications in the cloud. It is a powerful service that helps in building applications quickly without reinventing the components or modules. Services like analytics, authentication, databases, configuration, file storage, push messaging are provided by firebase thereby making it easy for the developers to focus on the user experience of the application.

                                    That is why we are using Firebase.
